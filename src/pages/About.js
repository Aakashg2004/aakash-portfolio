        About Me
      </h2>
      <p className="text-white/80 text-lg leading-relaxed text-center">
        I'm a passionate B.Tech student specializing in Artificial Intelligence & Data Science with a CGPA of 8.2/10. I love building intelligent systems that solve real-world problems in meaningful ways. My journey is driven by curiosity, hands-on exploration, and the belief that technology can drive change â€” from sustainable flight routing to AI-powered audio recognition.
        <br /><br />
        Outside the classroom, I actively build projects and explore tools like Python, Power BI, React, and Tailwind. I'm continuously learning, evolving, and striving to bring creativity, logic, and a user-focused mindset to every project I work on.
